# Rank and weighted random order

"""
Plan is to assign a certain number of lottery balls to each movie depending on their position

Each movie begins with 1 lottery ball

We will then add a ball for each movie's rank

1: +1
1-5: +1
1-10: +1
1-20: +1
1-30: +1
1-40: +1
1-50: +1
1-100: +1

If thereâ€™s a tie, the movie is counted in the better group.
